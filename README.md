# Neural-Network-Scratch

A neural network implementation from scratch using Rust. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of neural networks, including feedforward and backpropagation, along with essential matrix operations.

## Features

- **Feedforward Neural Network**: Process inputs through multiple layers to produce outputs.
- **Backpropagation**: Implemented to adjust weights based on the error of the output.
- **Activation Functions**: Includes popular activation function as Sigmoid.
- **Matrix Operations**: Basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and dot multiplication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
